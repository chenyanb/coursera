#tips

Actually,it can be more convenient to implement the second task, RandomizedQueue, in array. It is more easy for array to Iterator in random order, you canupset the array firstly, which there is a achieved function and then iterator it in order. As for delete, produce a random index, than exchange arr[index] with arr[size-1] and then delete arr[size-1],which is equal to delete  arr[index] directly as the array is not ask for storaging in order.
    Implete in arrar is more efficient and convenient.
