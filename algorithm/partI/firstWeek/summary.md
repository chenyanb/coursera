##key tips

Every time you don't need a reference, than remember to delete the referencr.

at once time, i didn't delete the reference, maybe i just know the concept.

And i just add one line coding
```java
test = null;
```
than my score improved, frome 95 to 100.

The key is not the score, but make clear what is the reference mean.

#Remember to delete references once you don't need it.
